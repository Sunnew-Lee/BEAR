# BEAR

- **Team Name:** Hat Trick  
- **Game Name:** BEAR
- **Engine:** Unreal Engine 5 version 5.03
- **Platform:** Windows
- **Story:**  
  Our game is set in a factory, weathered by time and abandoned by it too. Isolated by a vast empty expanse, you play as a small teddy bear that seems to have become alive through means you don’t fully understand.
  One thing is clear though, and it’s that this environment is not welcoming. Your goal is to navigate through this dark, tense place through simple but elegant platforming to find your way out before you’re unable to.

## Core Mechanics
- Ragdolling
    - A core addition to movement where the player can do a small dash midair by ragdolling
    - Used to hide from potential enemies by ‘playing dead’ (like the toys in “Toy Story” when humans are nearby)

- Ledge Hang
    - The player can grab ledges to get to new heights
- Enemies
    - Floating enemies with searchlights that are seeking the player
- Pushable Crates
    - Crates the player can push around to get to new heights
- Slides
    - Slides force the player to ragdoll and move downwards, as if it were a frictionless surface
- Destructible floors
    - Adds more dynamic gameplay experience
